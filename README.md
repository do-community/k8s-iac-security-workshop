# Kubernetes Infrastructure as Code Gamified 

This workshop was first run at [SnykCon 2021](https://snyk.io/snykcon/). 

## Instructions 
1. By yourself or in a small group, spend at least 25 minutes look ingthrough the files in this repository and try to identify at least 7 security vulnerabilities. 

Hint: 
- 2 high-severity security vulnerabilities
- 5 medium-severity security vulnerabilities

If you have no idea where to start looking, itâ€™s okay! Pick an article from the resources section, read through it and try to find one issue to look for.

2. After looking through the repo, fork this into your github account, sign up for [Snyk](https://snyk.io/product/infrastructure-as-code-security/), run this through the IAC scanner. Make changes to fix the issues and then run the scan again. Celebrate when you have fixed the 7 vulnerabilities!
